Net-CANbus

The Net::CANbus module provides an XS wrapper around
"can-utils" C library which interacts with the CANbus.

can-utils are located here:

Kudos and all rights reserved for "can-utils".
I don't claim their code, I am just using it.

DEVICE CONFIGURATION IN LINUX
This article explains it very well:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SocketCAN

To test this code it is sufficient to create a
virtucal CAN interface. Copying from the above page:

 modprobe can
 modprobe can_raw
 modprobe vcan
 sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
 sudo ip link set up vcan0
 ip link show vcan0

And if all goes well you should be able to see the vcan0 interface:

    vcan0: <NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 72 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
         link/can
